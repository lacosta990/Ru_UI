	merge pull requests
	
	muos-base (rg*xx family):
		on hold
		https://github.com/MustardOS
		volume doesn't work
			updates correctly in MinUI (with no audio)
			but maxes out in minarch
			changing from `lineout volume` to `digital volume` fixes...
		doesn't detect charging state
			sometimes
			seems to have resolved itself
		change default shell in /etc/passwd
		use C reboot(); for poweroff and reboot (see poweroff_real and reboot_real in other)
			try this on original miyoomini
	
	figure out uncommitted changes
		what to keep
		what to nuke
		
		really feeling like a fresh start
		no more monolithic repos
		just start fresh with any new device that catches my eye
		or not, just walk away
	
	document map.txt
		allow hiding files with map, eg. neogeo.bios .neogeo.bios
			remove . files after sort?
	
	pretty sure nothing uses the various platform.h BUTTON_* macros (because SDLK_* mappings are so spotty on these devices)
		pretty sure they all use CODE_* or JOY_* now

	macos (for modern compiler and debugging tools not for release!)
		minarch
	
	add extra atari7800 A78.pak
		https://github.com/libretro/prosystem-libretro
	rg35xxplus/h
		auto.sh isn't working here
		figure out
			fceumm audio crackle
				this is caused by SDL_RenderPresent() taking a long time on stock fw (and MOSS on the RGB30)
			judder
				vsync? nope...
			audio crackle on quit sdl
				setting raw volume to 0 doesn't fix
			implement jack
				sysfs state doesn't update
			check hdmi
				nothing
				/dev/hdmi?

	unzip60
		rename Makefile.trimuismartpro to just Makefile.minui?
	gkdpixel
		usb mode
			rndis? related? /etc/default/configfs
		bootlogo?
			haven't located on disk or in memory
		figure out dual sdcard support for mini?
		non-plus snes9x2005 for perf?
		codify alt paks to use stock standalone emus in MinUI
		light bleed
			experiement with /sys/devices/platform/jz-pwm-dev.0/jz-pwm/pwm0/period
				default is 10000
				nothing
		graphics
			jitter while scrolling
			but only on randon launches
			othertimes it's perfectly smooth (same core, same game)
		subpixel scaler work underway
				gb/gbc
				gba
				nes/snes
	
	native Files.pak
		I might just need to accept some duplication with MinUI (eg. Array and Directory/Entry arrays)
	m17
		still haven't found way to disable volume controls
			I think it's controlled by /usr/bin/gpio-volctrl.sh
			but rootfs is a 500MB ro squashfs so patching isn't really ideal
	all
		investigate Clock.pak issues (timezone related primarily)
		evtest
			random note: doesn't know about /dev/input/js0?
		standarize /bin/shutdown
			while (1) pause(); prevents shutdown on some platforms
			just system("rm /tmp/minui_exec") and exit(0) ?
		.res
			use standard naming (replace ext with png instead of append png)
		better document the new Bootlogo.paks
		
		collections can't handle accented characters (eg. é) in path/rom name...
			wait, why can recents.txt but not collections.txt?
			because one is written by the device so its using device native accented chars
		update stored rom path logic to only require TAG and not full folder name? (would simplify Collection authoring?)
		add make fetch to get all external sources before build?
		add Developer.pak
			only for devices with adb or ssh
			
		rewrite Shortcuts section by device not the tangle mess it currently is
			maybe do the same for all?
			break out platforms into completely separate installers/updaters?
				will require revisiting unzipping system
				will need to inject not replace
					but then how to handle removing deleted files?
		look into mednafen/beetle ngp core (neopop?)
			beetle-ngp-libretro
			this ran at about 1 frame per 10 seconds...on rgb30
			add logging
		wonderswan
			runs at 1fps
			possibly because minarch forces 60fps but this handheld runs at 75?
			
		draw debug to core framebufer before scaling
			using pixel instead of default font so it will fit on things like PKM and GB*
		
	tg5040
		create PSP.pak and NDS.pak and document how to setup by copying assets from stock?
			
		can't detect headphone state at boot?
		wifi
			Splore.pak can pull updated lists from bbs but cannot download carts
				no idea why
			this seems to be necessary to enable wifi even if operstat is up (is that just hardware status versus online status??)
				udhcpc -i wlan0 -S -t 5 -T 7 -b -q
		n64
			requires libretro opengl implementation
		psp
			after adding xrgb8888 support to MinUI it still chokes on a number of missing libraries 
			and eventually an unlinked function (something like XUnlockMutex)
	
	sdl2
		figure out how analogs work and hook them up (if only to double d-pad)
	
	user reported
		random reports of minui not booting reliably 
			first smart
				can't reproduce
				already waits 3 seconds
			then rgb30
				related to orphaned clusters issue? likely
				if so it needs to either be solved in MOSS/JELOS (RIP)
				or the other platforms MinUI supports (the non-Plus Mini in particular has a really terrible shutdown process at least on older firmwares)
		
	move PLAT_isOnline() into PWR_* formally
			
	all
		revisit localization?
		pull latest gpsp (fixes for long standing problem games I guess?)
			nope, breaks save state compatibility
			oddly it appears to be fixed on a branch? https://github.com/libretro/gpsp/commit/8745bf3d8fbb708db13bb726e5d89a6832f74d73
				but it looks like the save state format has been updated 2 more times since then so using that commit as a patch probably won't work
			f4e65d15 is known safe
			broken
				f0bacff
				bcd062e
			works!
				1d1c719
	
	minarch:
		crop save state pillar/letter-boxing?
		force aspect over hdmi? (or at least disable cropped?)
	
	rgb30
		does jack detection work?
		could wifi support more than one access point?
			an additional two lines for each AP?
			then try them in order?
			
		volume buttons sometimes get stuck
			haven't figured out how to reproduce reliably but I've had it happen kinda frequently
			just experienced on the smart so it's probably something in keymon
		figure out why power suspends the device after MOSS install
			it appears to reboot but it only stops suspending after a manual reboot
			fewt has a fix?
				https://github.com/JustEnoughLinuxOS/distribution/pull/2195/files#diff-719d790f2d3c1d5a0884ae9eb69fb77956fcaaae235282acb6e6817339f35105

		do some benchmarking to see where the slowdown is coming from
			the software scaler?
			the core?
			minarch?
			sdl12-compat?
			
		performance issues (both frame rate and audio clipping)
			fceuum 
			picodrive
			vb
			pcsx
			could this have anything to do with the performance versus userspace governor?
				no
			I think it's caused by the forced vsync in sdl2 (still most likely)
				unless the JELOS build process is lying about rebuilding without that patch, nope
			or fullscreen blitting? 
				nope
			I think I need to look into SDL2 audio handling (since it wasn't an issue with SDL1 but was with the SDL2-backed SDL12-compat)
				tried disabling pulse/pipewire (using alsa anyway)
					nope
				could it be non-threaded? that would be insane right?
	
	moss
		build lib32 to try to fix snes9x save state compatibility
			first attempt did not go well :sweat_smile:
		
	trimui: scaling (see DE test)
		
known issues
	all: race core (NGP/C.pak) doesn't restore audio state correctly
	miyoomini: debug/battery overlay isn't implemented
	trimuismart: debug/battery overlay isn't available/implemented
	rgb30: light crackling in some cores (eg. fceumm and snes9x2005_plus)
	rgb30: debug/battery overlay isn't available/implemented
	tg5040: debug/battery overlay isn't available/implemented

	trimui: hw scaling isn't implemented yet
	trimui: debug/battery overlay isn't implemented yet
	nano: says it can bind MENU+button for shortcuts, it can't

all
	minarch
		GFX_blitMessage() screen w/h is 0,0 for some reason
		doesn't pickup on core setting ratio changes? eg. fceumm
		prevent MENU+button from triggering button
		prevent binding same MENU+button to control and shortcut at same time
			reset the newer input to None and show a message, ideal something like:
				MENU+<button> is already bound to (<name> shortcut|<name> control)
	clock
		factor in timezone offset?
	simple progress animation for installing/updating
		launch as a daemon with &
		draws in a corner
		kill after install/update complete
		if it's circular we don't even need to worry about rotation :sweat_smile:
	main makefile
		targets have too many dependencies
		getting a little better
	cores
		add optional per core patch folder
			currently looks for a global one in all/cores
		move all the CORE_* vars up to all/cores (since they ended up all being the same)
		there has got to be a better way to main these patches
			updating fake-08 was so much copy/pasting
	api
		GFX_blitDebug(text,x,y)?
			simple for everything but trimuismart with its -90° screen
	minui
		support multiple tags in folder name?
			eg. Super Nintendo (SFC,SFCALT)
			where SFX.pak is only present on higher power systems and
			SFCALT.pak is an older core meant for lower power systems
			states will not be compatible because of the different core but...
		shows games in alt collated folders even if the alt pak isn't present...
			not sure how that's possible...
		alt tag is getting truncated, should be added after truncation
	add a "res" (or "many"?) folder 
		for install/update and charging gfx?
	show
	say
	confirm

smart
	cores
		supa starfox perf bad

miyoomini
	separate settings file for mini and plus?
	battery overlay

miniplus
	-
	
rg35xx
	revisit hdmi basedon rgb30 implementation?
	overclock.elf with userspace versus performance
		performance should be slower because it will max out to the max defined scaling frequency
		userspace should accept the specific scaling frequency
		re: NDS.pak
		
		XQuader figured out that CPUs are unlocked with performance but not userspace
			the following will unlock them:
				echo 0xf > /sys/devices/system/cpu/autoplug/plug_mask
				echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
				echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu2/online
				echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu3/online
			but using performance instead of userspace has the same result so maybe just use that
				as long as it doesn't kill battery life?
			turns oout this was discovered back in may by another user:
				https://www.reddit.com/r/RG35XX/comments/13rtrqb/minuis_snes_performance/
				https://github.com/shauninman/MinUI-Legacy-RG35XX/compare/main...zoli0726:union-minui:main
				seems like this is sufficient to unlock the improved performance
					echo 0xF > /sys/devices/system/cpu/autoplug/plug_mask
					though I'm not sure I'm observing a difference...(at least when applying over adb)
		
	charging screen isn't working for someone on RH discord
		charging.png isn't being copied to MISC during install (it should only be omitted during update)
	how to handle updating on mini and missing TF1 updates as a result?
		could I write the version to the .minstalled file
		if it doesn't match the current one run the installer
		trimui smart has a similar issue now
			the bootstrap folder updates /etc/main

nano
	the lack of shared SD card support is a big downer
		abandon this platform?
		have I documented the boot process or how to create the modified firmware image?
	L+R and d-pad to offset cropped "scaling"?
	keep an eye out for a 60fps fix
		https://github.com/DrUm78/linux/tags
		I think I got it (though I coudln't tell it wasn't running 60fps before so...)
		this might be running worse after the fix...
	test nano MinUI SD in all other (fully) supported devices
		no joy :sob:
		can the boot partition be hidden from other devices?
		or can I change the boot order to prioritize nand over sd?
	minarch
		cores
			sfc - not great, non-plus is better but still struggles with sfx chip games like SF or YI
			psx?
		patches
	hardware scaling
		no? but screen is so tiny, relative ppi so high, it might not matter
	is overclocking possible?
		no?
	installer/updater
		(build into /etc/rcS logic)

trimui
	overclock
		crashy
	scaling
	overlay
	create core patches
	
	cores
		picodrive
			doesn't recover from quicksave reliably...
		snes9x2005_plus 
			no sound
		snes9x2005
			only running at ~45fps
			frameskip of 1 is probably necessary but 2005 doesn't have that option
			will need to patch
		gpsp
			ffiv requires manual frameskip of 1 to not chug on mode7-like bits

	
rg35xx/install and miyoomini/install have png/bmp versions of the same files
	as do miyoomini/dat/ and rg35xx/ramdisk/

sf2000
	hahahahahahaha no.

FIXME: main makefile is a brittle mess
	each platform has its own default cores and extras
	so it's a tangle

---

1. makefile routes requests through makefile.toolchain
2. which clones the toolchain repo if necessary and
3. spins up a docker to run workspace/makefile build for each/the target platform
4. which builds commone elfs and punts to workspace/PLATFORM/makefile
5. which builds unique platform elfs

there's more to this now (eg. PLATFORM/makefile.copy)

potential mm+ identifier
	/customer/app/axp_test exists
	/miyoo354 instead of /miyoo

replace 
	git clone repo && cd repo && git checkout branch 
with
	git clone --depth 1 --branch branch repo
note: doesn't work with commits only branches
